I am a first-year PhD candidate at the University of Twente, pursuing research in robotic control, computer vision, and deep learning. My work focuses on developing novel techniques for ultrasound image segmentation and real-time robotic systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Kenan Niu from the Robotics and Mechatronics (RAM) group at the University of Twente. My research aims to bridge the gap between AI-based vision systems and robotic control applications.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
